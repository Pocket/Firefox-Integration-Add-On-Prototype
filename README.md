# Firefox-Integration-Add-On-Prototype

This code served as the basis for collaboration between Pocket and Mozilla on the Pocket integration in Firefox 38.0.5. Initially prototyped with an add-on as seen in this repo, the code was moved into mozilla-central prior to launch.

This repo is unlikely to see further development. For suggested patches, pull requests or issues, please file this directly in Bugzilla, under the Pocket component.
